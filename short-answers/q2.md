# Question
In a code snippet, demonstrate inheritance by creating two classes where one is the parent class and one is the child class.

In your code example, create an instance of the child class and reference/invoke a property/method of the parent class.

# Answer
```js
class Parent {
  constructor (name, age){
    this.name = name // name is a property of Parent class
    this.age = age // age is the property of Parent class
  }

  // Method in the parent class
  introduce() {
    return `My name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
} 

  class Child extends Parent {
    constructor (name, age, grade) {
      super (name,age)  // reference/invoke a property of the Parent class
      this.grade = grade // creating an instance of the Child class / grade is a property of Child class
    }

  // Method in the child class
    showGrade() {
    return `${this.name} is in grade ${this.grade}.`;
  }
}
```
