# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism refers to similar objects being able to be used in different ways. The code below shows polymorphism. The method `introduce()` in the Child class is overriding the introduce method in the Parent class.
```js
class Parent {
  constructor (name, age){
    this.name = name // name is a property of Parent class
    this.age = age // age is the property of Parent class
  }

  // Method in the parent class
  introduce() {
    return `My name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
} 

  class Child extends Parent {
    constructor (name, age, grade) {
      super (name,age)  // reference/invoke a property of the Parent class
      this.grade = grade // creating an instance of the Child class / grade is a property of Child class
    }

  // Method in the child class
    showGrade() {
    return `${this.name} is in grade ${this.grade}.`;
  }
  
  // Method in Child class invoking Parent's introduce method
  introduce() {
    super.introduce(); // Invoke Parent's introduce method using super
    console.log(`I am in grade ${this.grade}.`);
  }
}
```
Question is it better to rename the introduce method in the Child class or is it better to keep it the same (for grader)
