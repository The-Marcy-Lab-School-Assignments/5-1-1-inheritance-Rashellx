# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer
The difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method is that `instance` methods belong to instances of the class and operates on these specific instances acessing specific data using the `this` keyword. On the other hand, `class` methods are assiocated with the class itself (it is generic) and use the `static` keyword to define this type of method.
